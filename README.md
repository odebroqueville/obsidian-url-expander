# Obsidian URL Expander Plugin

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

The plugin essentially expands shortened urls (e.g. bit.ly, t.co, etc.) to their long version as a Markdown link. The plugin was created to have more descriptivee links than the ones imported from tweets via Readwise, for example. 

## Commands made available by the plugin

The plugin offers 3 commands:

1. Expand selected link
2. Expand all links in the active pane

These commands are available via the command palette or via the context menu in the File pane.

## Nota Bene

CMD-Z can usually be used to undo the changes.

## Dependencies and Inspiration

The plugin is based on Ivan Sanchez Ortega's [deshortify](https://gitlab.com/IvanSanchez/deshortify) to expand urls and the code was highly inspired by that of Ozan Tellioglu's [Obsidian Link Converter Plugin](https://github.com/ozntel/obsidian-link-converter).
